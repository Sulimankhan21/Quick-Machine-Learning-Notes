# Training Deep Neural Nets:

The whole game in Deep Learning is training you neural nets and tuning their parameters. Over last few years, many people have come up with many techniques, which makes your training and tuning process easier and faster.

You can roughly divide training process in 3 big problems:
1. Vanishing/ Exploding Gradients Problems
2. Optimization Problems
3. OVerfitting and Underfitting Problems


We will see different ways to speed up training (and reaching a better solution):
- Applying a good intialization strategy for connection weights
- Use a good activation function (ReLu, ELU)
- Using Batch Normalization
- Reusing parts of a pretrained network
- Faster optimization technique (Adam)
- Using better Regularization techniques (Dropout)
