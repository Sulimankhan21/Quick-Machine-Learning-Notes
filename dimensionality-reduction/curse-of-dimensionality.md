## The Curse of Dimensionality:

We are so used to living in 3 dimensional space that our intuition fails us when ever we try to imagine a high-dimensional space. Even a 4D hypercube is incredibly hard to picture in our mind, let alone 200-dimensional ellipsoid bent in a 1000 dimensional space.

**NOTE:** It turns out many things behave very different in high-dimensional space. For eg: if you pick a randome point in a unite sq (1X1), it will have only about 0.4% chance of being located less than 0.001 from border. In other words, it is very unlikely that a random point will be extreme along any dimension. 

But, in a 10,000 dimensional unit hypercube (1 X 1 X ! X....X 1) this probablity is greater than 99.99999%, Most points in high dimensional hypercube are very close of border.
