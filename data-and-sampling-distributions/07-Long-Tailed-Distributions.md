## Long-Tailed Distributions:

**Key Ideas :**
- data is generally not normally distributed.
- Assuming a normal distribution can lead to underestimation of extreme events (“black swans”).

- Tail : The long narrow portion of a frequency distribution, where relatively extreme values occur at low frequency.
- Skew : Where one tail of a distribution is longer than the other.
