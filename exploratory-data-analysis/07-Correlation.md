## Correlation

- Exploratory data analysis is many modeling projects (in data science) involves examining correlation among predictors, and 
between predictors and a target variable. 

- Variables X and Y are said to be positively correlated if high values of X go with high values of Y, and low values of X go with low values of Y. 
- If high values of X go with low values of Y, and vice versa, the variables are negatively correlated.


1. Correlation coefficient : A metric that measures the extent to which numeric variables are associated with one another (ranges from â€“1 to +1).
2. Correlation matrix : A table where the variables are shown on both rows and columns, and the cell values are the correlations between the variables.
3. Scatterplot : A plot in which the x-axis is the value of one variable, and the y-axis the value of another.
