## Bootstrap

One easy and effective way to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic, or of model parameters, is to draw additional 
samples, with replacement, from the sample itself and recalculate the statistic or model for each resample. This procedure is 
called the bootstrap, and it does not necessarily involve any assumptions about the data or the sample statistic being normally
distributed.

- Bootstrap sample : A sample taken with replacement from an observed data set.
- Resampling : The process of taking repeated samples from observed data; includes both bootstrap and permutation (shuffling) 
procedures.
