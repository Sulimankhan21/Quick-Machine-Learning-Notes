# Training Deep Neural Nets:

The whole game in Deep Learning is training you neural nets and tuning their parameters. Over last few years, many people have come up with many techniques, which makes your training and tuning process easier and faster.

You can roughly divide training process in 3 big problems:
1. Vanishing/ Exploding Gradients Problems
2. Optimization Problems
3. OVerfitting and Underfitting Problems
