# Ensemble Learning
 
### Why ensemble learning? Why does it work?
Suppose you ask a complex question to thousands of people, then generate their answer. In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than an expert's answer. This is called the **wisdom of the crowd**.

Similarly, if you aggregate the predictions of a group of predictiors (classifer/ regressors), you will often get better predictions than with the best indiviual predictor. 

A group of predictior is called an **ensemble**; thus this technique is called **ensemble learning**, and an Ensemble Learning algorithm is called an **Ensemble Method**.

For eg: Random forest, is an ensemble of decision trees.

Most popular Ensemble methods are bagging, boosting, stacking.
