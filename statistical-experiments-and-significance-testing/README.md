## Statistical Experiments and Significance Testing

### Why to design experiments? 
In order to confirm or reject a hypothesis.


## Statistical Inference Pipeline:
Formulate Hypothesis > Design Experiment > Collect Data > Inference/ Conclusion

**Step 1:** This process starts with a hypothesis (“drug A is better than the existing standard drug,” “price A is more profitable than 
the existing price B”). 
** Step 2:**  An experiment (it might be an A/B test) is designed to test the hypothesis—designed in such a way that, hopefully, 
will deliver conclusive results. 
** Step 3:**  The data is collected and analyzed, and then a conclusion is drawn. 
** Step 4:**  The term inference reflects the intention to apply the experiment results, which involve a limited set of data, to a larger process or 
population.
