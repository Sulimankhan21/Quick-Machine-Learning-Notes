## Recurrent Neural Networks:

A class of nets that can predict the future (well, up to a point, of course). They can analyze time series data such as stock prices, and tell you when to buy or sell. They can anticipate the car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally, they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on fixed size inputs like FNN/ CNNS.
