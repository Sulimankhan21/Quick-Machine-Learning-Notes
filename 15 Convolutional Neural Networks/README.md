# Convolutional Neural Networks:

### Inspiration for CNNs:
Neurons in the visual cortex have a small local receptive field, meaning they react only to visual stimuli located in a limited region of the visual field. The receptive fields of different neurons may overlap, and together they tile the whole visual fields. 

Also, some neurons react only to images of horizontal lines, while others react only to lines with different orientations. Some neurons have larger receptive fiels, and they react to more complex patters that are combinations of the lower level patterns. This observations led to the idea that the higher level neurons are based on the outputs of neighboring lower-level neurons. 

This powerful architecture, where you have neurons at different levels doing different work, lower level, mide level and higher level neurons are all used to decode difffernt and complex pattersn.
