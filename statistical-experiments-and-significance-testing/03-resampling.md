## Resampling

Resampling in statistics means to repeatedly sample values from observed data, with a general goal of assessing random 
variability in a statistic.

There are two main types of resampling procedures: 
- the bootstrap and 
- permutation tests. 

The bootstrap is used to assess the reliability of an estimate. Permutation tests are used to test hypotheses, typically involving two or more groups.
