## Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

The term sampling distribution of a statistic refers to the distribution of some sample statistic, over many samples drawn 
from the same population. Much of classical statistics is concerned with making inferences from (small) samples to 
(very large) populations.


- Sample statistic : A metric calculated for a sample of data drawn from a larger population.
- Data distribution : The frequency distribution of individual values in a data set.
- Sampling distribution : The frequency distribution of a sample statistic over many samples or resamples.
- Central limit theorem : The tendency of the sampling distribution to take on a normal shape as sample size rises.
- Standard error : The variability (standard deviation) of a sample statistic over many samples (not to be confused with standard deviation, which, by itself, refers to variability of individual data values).
