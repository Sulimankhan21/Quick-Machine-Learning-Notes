- they can perform both classification and regression (just like SVM).
- they can even perform multioutput tasks.
- they are powerful algorithms, that can fit complex datasets.
- fundamental components of random forest.

**Good Points:**
- they require very little data preparation.
- they don't require feature scaling or centering at all.
