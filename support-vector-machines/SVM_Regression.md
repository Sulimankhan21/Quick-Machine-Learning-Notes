# SVM Regression:
- not only supports linear and non-linear classification, but also supports linear and non-linear regression.
- The trick is to reverse the objective: instead of trying to fit the largest possible street between two classes while limiting margin violations, SVM Regression tries to fit as many instances as possible on the street while limiting the margin violations.
