## Exploring Binary and Categorical Data

For categorical data, simple proportions or percentages tell the story of the data.

Mode : The most commonly occurring category or value in a data set.
Expected value : When the categories can be associated with a numeric value, this gives an average value based on a categoryâ€™s probability of occurrence.
Bar charts : The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as bars.
Pie charts : The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as wedges in a pie.

### Bar charts:
Bar charts are a common visual tool for displaying a single categorical variable, often seen in the popular press. Categories 
are listed on the x-axis, and frequencies or proportions on the y-axis.

**Note** that a bar chart resembles a histogram; in a bar chart the x-axis represents different categories of a factor 
variable, while in a histogram the x-axis represents values of a single variable on a numeric scale. In a histogram, the 
bars are typically shown touching each other, with gaps indicating values that did not occur in the data. In a bar chart, 
the bars are shown separate from one another.

### Pie Charts:
Pie charts are an alternative to bar charts, although statisticians and data visualization experts generally eschew pie 
charts as less visually informative
