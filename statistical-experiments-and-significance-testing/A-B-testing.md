## A/B Testing:

- An A/B test is an experiment with two groups to establish which of two treatments, products, procedures, or the like is superior. 
- Often one of the two treatments is the standard existing treatment, or no treatment. If a standard (or no) treatment is used, 
it is called the control. 
- A typical hypothesis is that treatment is better than control.
