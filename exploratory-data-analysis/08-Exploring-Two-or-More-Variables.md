## Exploring Two or More Variables:

- Familiar estimators like mean and variance look at variables one at a time **(univariate analysis)**. 
- Correlation analysis is an important method that compares two variables **(bivariate analysis)**. 

In this section we look at additional estimates and plots, and at more than two variables **(multivariate analysis)**.
