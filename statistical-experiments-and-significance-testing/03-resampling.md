## Resampling

Resampling in statistics means to repeatedly sample values from observed data, with a general goal of assessing random 
variability in a statistic.

There are two main types of resampling procedures: 
- the bootstrap and 
- permutation tests. 

The bootstrap is used to assess the reliability of an estimate. Permutation tests are used to test hypotheses, typically involving two or more groups.

Permutation test : The procedure of combining two or more samples together, and randomly (or exhaustively) reallocating the observations to resamples. Also, called Randomization test, random permutation test, exact test.

With or without replacement : In sampling, whether or not an item is returned to the sample before the next draw.
