## Estimates of Variability:

- Location is just one dimension in summarizing a feature. 
- A second dimension, variability, measures whether the data values are tightly clustered or spread out. 
- At the heart of statistics lies variability: measuring it, reducing it, distinguishing random from real variability, 
identifying the various sources of real variability, and making decisions in the presence of it.


1. Deviations : The difference between the observed values and the estimate of location.
   - Synonyms : errors, residuals
2. Variance : The sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by n – 1 where n is the number of data values.
   - Synonyms : mean-squared-error
3. Standard deviation : The square root of the variance.
   - Synonyms : l2-norm, Euclidean norm
4. Mean absolute deviation : The mean of the absolute value of the deviations from the mean.
   - Synonyms : l1-norm, Manhattan norm
5. Median absolute deviation from the median : The median of the absolute value of the deviations from the median.
6. Range : The difference between the largest and the smallest value in a data set.
7. Order statistics : Metrics based on the data values sorted from smallest to biggest.
   - Synonyms : ranks
8. Percentile : The value such that P percent of the values take on this value or less and (100–P) percent take on this value or more.
   - Synonyms : quantile
9. Interquartile range : The difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile.
   - Synonyms : IQR

## Standard Deviation and Related Estimates:

1. Mean Absolute deviation

best-known estimates for variability are the variance and the standard deviation, 
2. Variance:
3. Std. Deviation: 
   - The standard deviation is much easier to interpret than the variance since it is on the same scale as the original data. 
   - standard deviation is preferred in statistics over the mean absolute deviation because working with squared values is 
   much more convenient than absolute values, especially for statistical models.
