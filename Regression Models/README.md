# Regression Models

### Performace Measure for Regression Problems:
1. Root Mean Square Error(RMSE):
   - gives idea how much error the system typically makes in its prediction
   - gives higher weight for larger errors.
   - corresponds to eculidian norm: also called L2 norm
   - denoted as ```|| . ||```

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
   - also called Avg. Absolute Deviation
   - also called Manhattan norm, becuase it measure the dist b/w 2 point ina  city if you can only travel along orthogonal city blocks.
