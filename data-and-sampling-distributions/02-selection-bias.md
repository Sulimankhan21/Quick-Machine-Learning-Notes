## Selection Bias:

Selection bias refers to the practice of selectively choosing data—consciously or unconsciously—in a way that leads to a 
conclusion that is misleading or ephemeral.


1. Bias : Systematic error.
2. Data snooping : Extensive hunting through data in search of something interesting.
3. Vast search effect : Bias or nonreproducibility resulting from repeated data modeling, or modeling data with large numbers of predictor variables.
