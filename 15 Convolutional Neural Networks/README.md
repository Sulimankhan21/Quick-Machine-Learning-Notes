# Convolutional Neural Networks:

### Inspiration for CNNs:
Neurons in the visual cortex have a small local receptive field, meaning they react only to visual stimuli located in a limited region of the visual field. The receptive fields of different neurons may overlap, and together they tile the whole visual fields.
