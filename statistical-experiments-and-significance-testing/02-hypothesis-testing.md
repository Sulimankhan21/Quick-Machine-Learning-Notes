## Hypothesis Tests:

Hypothesis tests, (also called significance tests) are used to learn whether random chance might be responsible for an observed effect.

**Key Terms:**
1. Null hypothesis : The hypothesis that chance is to blame.
2. Alternative hypothesis : Counterpoint to the null (what you hope to prove).
3. One-way test : Hypothesis test that counts chance results only in one direction.
4. Two-way test : Hypothesis test that counts chance results in two directions.
