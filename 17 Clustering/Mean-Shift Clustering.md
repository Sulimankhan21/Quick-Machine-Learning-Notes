## Mean-Shift Clustering

- Mean shift clustering is a sliding-window-based algorithm that attempts to find dense areas of data points. 
- It is a centroid-based algorithm meaning that the goal is to locate the center points of each group/class, which works by updating candidates for center points to be the mean of the points within the sliding-window.
