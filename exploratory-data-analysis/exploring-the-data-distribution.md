## Data Distribution:

1. **Boxplot** : A plot introduced by Tukey as a quick way to visualize the distribution of data.
   - Synonyms : Box and whiskers plot

- Percentiles are also valuable to summarize the entire distribution. 
- It is common to report the quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) and the deciles (the 10th, 20th, â€¦, 90th percentiles). 
- Percentiles are especially valuable to summarize the tails (the outer range) of the distribution. 

- Boxplots, are based on percentiles and give a quick way to visualize the distribution of data.
- The top and bottom of the box are the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. 
- The median is shown by the horizontal line in the box. 
- The dashed lines, referred to as whiskers, extend from the top and bottom to indicate the range for the bulk of the data. 

2. Frequency table : A tally of the count of numeric data values that fall into a set of intervals (bins).
3. Histogram : A plot of the frequency table with the bins on the x-axis and the count (or proportion) on the y-axis.
4. Density plot : A smoothed version of the histogram, often based on a kernal density estimate.
