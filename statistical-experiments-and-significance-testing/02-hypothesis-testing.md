## Hypothesis Tests:

Hypothesis tests, (also called significance tests) are used to learn whether random chance might be responsible for an observed effect.

**Key Terms:**
1. Null hypothesis : The hypothesis that chance is to blame.
2. Alternative hypothesis : Counterpoint to the null (what you hope to prove).
3. One-way test : Hypothesis test that counts chance results only in one direction.
4. Two-way test : Hypothesis test that counts chance results in two directions.

**NOTE**
- An A/B test is typically constructed with a hypothesis in mind. 
- For example, the hypothesis might be that price B produces higher profit. 

### Why do we need a hypothesis? Why not just look at the outcome of the experiment and go with whichever treatment does better?

The answer lies in the tendency of the human mind to underestimate the scope of natural random behavior. 
- One manifestation of this is the failure to anticipate extreme events, or so-called “black swans”/“Long-Tailed Distributions”. 
- Another manifestation is the tendency to misinterpret random events as having patterns of some significance. Statistical hypothesis testing was invented as a way to protect researchers from being fooled by random chance.

In a properly designed A/B test, you collect data on treatments A and B in such a way that any observed difference between A and B must be due to either:
  - Random chance in assignment of subjects
  - A true difference between A and B

A statistical hypothesis test is analysis of an A/B test, or any randomized experiment, to assess whether random chance is a reasonable explanation for the observed difference between groups A and B.
