## Exploring Two or More Variables:

- Familiar estimators like mean and variance look at variables one at a time **(univariate analysis)**. 
- Correlation analysis is an important method that compares two variables **(bivariate analysis)**. 

In this section we look at additional estimates and plots, and at more than two variables **(multivariate analysis)**.

1. Contingency tables : A tally of counts between two or more categorical variables.
2. Hexagonal binning : A plot of two numeric variables with the records binned into hexagons.
3. Contour plots : A plot showing the density of two numeric variables like a topographical map.
4. Violin plots : Similar to a boxplot but showing the density estimate.
