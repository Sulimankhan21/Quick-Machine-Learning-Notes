## Support Vector Machines
1. ML model capable of perfomring, linear or non-linear classification, regression, and even outlier detection.
2. suited for classification of complex, but small- or medium sized datasets.

- Types: Large margin classification and Soft margin classification

### Large Margin Classification:
You can think of SVM classifier as fitting the widest possible street between classes. this is called large margin 
classification.

### Things to note:
- SVM is sensitive to the features scales.
